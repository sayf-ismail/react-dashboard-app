# Getting Started with Create React App

## See the app live here: https://sayf-react-dashboard-app.herokuapp.com/

### Instructions for installation:
1. clone the repo to your machine
2. run `yarn` or `npm install` 3. 
3. launch the server.js file with `node server.js`4. 
4. launch the react app with `yarn start`

### Things I managed to accomplish:- 
- Managed components and pages rendering with ReactRouter
- Login with sessionStorage.
- Conditional Rendering depending on whether Tasks are present.
- Rendering the TodoList and click element for completion
- Created a node.js backend with express.js to provide an api token to the frontend upon login.

### Challenges I faced and could not complete within 5 days:- 
- Dashboard elements - had trouble figuring out how to find elements by className to calculate progress
- Overall UI/UX as functionality was my priority
- 
I will continue to work on this app, as I enjoyed learning more about react.
